## Project Title: How to Measure Dignity Globally in the Development Sector
## Organization: IDinsight

This project aims to improve the understanding of how experiences of dignity vary. Using a conceptual framework and survey data, this project will explore the potential sources of variation, draw conclusions, and propose an instrument and analysis plan for a multi-country study of experiences of respect for dignity. Findings are expected to contribute to IDinsightâ€™s Dignity Initiative.

## Deliverables
Data package: statistical analysis plan, datasets, comprehensible and reproducible analysis code in R, and outputs
Global survey package: draft survey, statistical analysis plan and analysis code in R
Policy brief and presentation describing work done and main conclusions about how dignity varies and how the Global Survey would enhance our understanding of this
