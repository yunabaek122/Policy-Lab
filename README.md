## Project Title: How to Measure Dignity Globally in the Development Sector
## Organization: IDInsight

This project aims to improve the understanding of how experiences of dignity vary. Using a conceptual framework and survey data, this project will explore the potential sources of variation, draw conclusions, and propose an instrument and analysis plan for a multi-country study of experiences of respect for dignity. Findings are expected to contribute to IDinsightâ€™s Dignity Initiative.
